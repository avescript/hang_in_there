**🐱 HANG IN THERE**

_Daily Stories of Grit, Grace & Human Connection_

**USER PERSONAS**

Version 1.0 | February 2026

**Overview**

This document defines five primary user personas for the Hang In There platform. Each persona is grounded in the PRD's target audience research — professionals experiencing burnout, values-driven adults seeking authentic hope, educators, community builders, and purpose-seeking young professionals. Together, they represent the range of real people who will find genuine value in one verified, beautifully told story per day.

Personas are organized from highest product-fit urgency to broadest growth opportunity. Each includes at-a-glance demographics, motivations, pain points, media behavior, app use patterns, feature priorities, and a design/tone consideration for the product team.

| **Tech Use**   | Heavy — laptop all day, phone constantly, uses apps to manage both work and wellness |

_"I want to feel hopeful, but I'm tired of content that feels like it's trying to sell me something."_

**MOTIVATIONS & PAIN POINTS**

| ✦ What Drives Them                             | ✦ What Weighs on Them                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Reconnect with purpose after years of grinding | Doomscrolling leaves her depleted but she can't stop |
| Find grounding moments during her workday      | Wellness apps feel corporate and shallow             |
| Feel less alone in her struggles               | 77-hour weeks left her creatively empty              |
| Believe the world is basically good            | Skeptical of 'positivity' content — it feels fake    |

**RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA & TECH**

Maya checks her phone within minutes of waking. She follows design blogs, climate news, and science journalism. She's unsubscribed from most push notifications — too noisy — but she'd make an exception for something that felt genuinely worth her time. She's tried meditation apps and deleted them. She reads The Guardian's Upside column when she finds it. She's actively looking for reasons to feel good about the world.

**HOW HANG IN THERE FITS IN THEIR DAY**

Maya would read Hang In There during her morning coffee before opening Slack — a 3-minute ritual that sets a different tone for the day. She'd save stories to revisit on hard afternoons. Over time, the streak counter would become a quiet point of pride. She'd share stories with her partner, especially ones about environmental stewardship.

**Features They'll Love**

▸ Push notification at 7:45 AM — before the workday noise starts

▸ Story Save feature for her personal archive

▸ Theme tags so she can find stories about sustainability on tough climate-news days

▸ The streak counter — low-pressure but satisfying

▸ Clean, quiet design that doesn't feel like an app trying to keep her hooked

**Story Themes That Resonate**

| Grit & Tenacity | Environmental | Work/Life Balance | Universal Love |
| :-------------: | :-----------: | :---------------: | :------------: |

**Design & Tone Consideration**

Maya is visually literate and will immediately notice if the design is cluttered or generic. She needs the experience to feel crafted, calm, and honest. Avoid anything that feels gamified, algorithmically manipulative, or like it's optimizing for engagement time rather than her wellbeing.

**🤝 David Okafor**  
 _The Quietly Exhausted Team Lead_

**AT A GLANCE**

| Age            | 42                                                                                            | He/Him |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Location**   | Atlanta, GA                                                                                   |
| **Occupation** | Engineering Manager at a mid-size logistics company                                           |

| **Tech Use**   | Moderate-to-high — relies on tech for work, more selective at home; prefers simple interfaces |

_"My team is struggling with morale and honestly, so am I. I need something real, not a pep talk."_

**MOTIVATIONS & PAIN POINTS**

| ✦ What Drives Them                                       | ✦ What Weighs on Them                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Support his team's morale without sounding like a poster | Feels pressure to project optimism while running on empty |
| Model healthy habits for his kids                        | Cynical about corporate wellness initiatives              |
| Stay connected to what matters beyond work               | Limited time — everything competes for his attention      |
| Find content he can share authentically                  | Worries he's modeling burnout behavior for his children   |

**RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA & TECH**

David listens to podcasts during his commute — mostly economics, history, and the occasional sports pod. He doesn't spend much time on social media anymore. He reads newsletters selectively and will forward something to his team if it's substantive. He's cautious about recommending content because it reflects on him — he needs to trust what he shares.

**HOW HANG IN THERE FITS IN THEIR DAY**

David discovers Hang In There through a newsletter or colleague recommendation. He reads it during his commute or lunch. He'd use it to share stories with his team at the start of weekly standups — a gentle ritual to remind everyone why the work matters. He'd donate $5/month without hesitation if the platform felt trustworthy and well-made.

**Features They'll Love**

▸ The Share button — clean text/image excerpts he can paste into Slack

▸ Source attribution — he won't share something he can't verify

▸ Organizations & movements stories — relevant to team dynamics

▸ Email digest option (Phase 2\) — fits his newsletter habit

▸ No algorithm, no ads, no manipulation — he can trust it

**Story Themes That Resonate**

| Community & Mutual Support | Grit & Tenacity | Work/Life Balance | Care for All Beings |
| :------------------------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :-----------------: |

**Design & Tone Consideration**

David values clarity and credibility over aesthetic flair. The editorial voice and source attribution matter more to him than animations or visual polish. He needs to feel the platform is run by people who care about getting it right, not just making it look good.

**📚 Priya Sundaram**  
 _The Values-Driven Educator_

**AT A GLANCE**

| Age            | 29                                                                                           | She/Her |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Location**   | Austin, TX                                                                                   |
| **Occupation** | Middle school science teacher; adjunct community college instructor on weekends              |
| **Household**  | Shares an apartment with a roommate; single; close to her family                             |
| **Tech Use**   | Moderate — practical about tech, uses what serves her; avoids platforms that feel extractive |

_"My students see so much negativity. I want to give them evidence that ordinary people do extraordinary things."_

**MOTIVATIONS & PAIN POINTS**

| ✦ What Drives Them                                         | ✦ What Weighs on Them                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bring evidence-based hope into her classroom               | Most 'inspirational' content is either fake or culturally narrow |
| Counter the cynicism her students absorb from social media | She's exhausted by unpaid emotional labor at school              |
| Find stories that reflect diverse communities globally     | Can't afford premium content subscriptions on a teacher's salary |
| Feel personally recharged — teaching takes everything      | Worries the world her students inherit will be worse             |

**RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA & TECH**

Priya reads widely — NPR, science journalism, global news. She uses Twitter/X sparingly and primarily as a professional tool. She's active in teacher communities online and often shares resources. She trusts content that cites sources and has a clear editorial voice. She's enthusiastic about free, mission-driven platforms and will advocate for them if she believes in them.

**HOW HANG IN THERE FITS IN THEIR DAY**

Priya reads Hang In There while prepping lessons on weekend mornings. She'd print or project story excerpts in class — especially environmental and community stories — as discussion starters. She'd share the platform in teacher forums and parent newsletters. She'd be a powerful organic advocate if the content reflects the diversity she and her students need to see.

**Features They'll Love**

▸ Free access with no paywalls — critical on a teacher's budget

▸ Inclusive representation across genders, ethnicities, nationalities

▸ Environmental stewardship stories — directly tied to her curriculum

▸ Archive with keyword search — she can find stories by theme for lessons

▸ Story submission tips — she wants to nominate people in her community

**Story Themes That Resonate**

| Environmental Stewardship | Community & Mutual Support | Care for All Beings | Universal Love |
| :-----------------------: | :------------------------: | :-----------------: | :------------: |

**Design & Tone Consideration**

Priya needs the platform to feel inclusive and globally minded from the first story she reads. If the first five stories skew Western or male, she'll quietly disengage. Diversity in subject representation is not a nice-to-have for her — it's the proof of the platform's sincerity.

**🌱 Tom Russo**  
 _The Reluctant Optimist_

**AT A GLANCE**

| Age            | 58                                                                                                           | He/Him |

| **Tech Use**   | Low-to-moderate — uses a smartphone and tablet, comfortable with simple apps; no patience for complicated UX |

_"I've seen the worst of what people do to each other. I need reminding that the good stuff is real too."_

**MOTIVATIONS & PAIN POINTS**

| ✦ What Drives Them                                                  | ✦ What Weighs on Them                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Process 30 years of accumulated vicarious trauma                    | News cycle confirms his darker worldview                            |
| Stay connected to a sense of community after retiring               | Retirement left a hole where purpose used to be                     |
| Have something meaningful to share with his grandchild's generation | Dislikes complicated interfaces and dark patterns                   |
| Believe the world he's leaving behind is worth fighting for         | Suspicious of anything that feels like spin or corporate positivity |

**RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA & TECH**

Tom watches local news and reads the paper. He's not on social media much — Facebook occasionally for family. He listens to talk radio during his commute to the garden. He responds strongly to real, unadorned storytelling — no gloss. He'd probably discover the app through word of mouth from a family member or community member.

**HOW HANG IN THERE FITS IN THEIR DAY**

Tom would read Hang In There over morning coffee before heading to his garden. He'd share stories aloud with his wife. He'd be particularly moved by community stories — people rebuilding after disaster, neighbors showing up for each other. He'd appreciate the lack of ads and algorithms. He might not understand 'PWA' but he'd notice that the site just works.

**Features They'll Love**

▸ Simple, clean design that doesn't require onboarding

▸ One story per day — no overwhelm, no rabbit holes

▸ Community & mutual support stories that feel close to home

▸ The ability to save stories to share with family

▸ A donation option — he'd give what he could if he trusted the mission

**Story Themes That Resonate**

| Community & Mutual Support | Grit & Tenacity | Care for All Beings | Universal Love |
| :------------------------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: | :------------: |

**Design & Tone Consideration**

Tom will bounce immediately if the interface is confusing, text is too small, or he feels like he's being sold something. He needs the very first experience to be simple, welcoming, and self-explanatory. Large readable text, high contrast, and a warm visual design are not optional for this user — they're the entrance fee.

| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Location**   | Brooklyn, NY                                                                                  |
| **Occupation** | Junior copywriter at an advertising agency; freelance climate advocate on the side            |
| **Household**  | Shares an apartment with two friends; student loan debt; found-family social circle           |
| **Tech Use**   | Very high — digital native; early adopter; aware of and critical of attention economy tactics |

_"I know social media is bad for me. I just want something that earns my attention instead of stealing it."_

**MOTIVATIONS & PAIN POINTS**

| ✦ What Drives Them                                                        | ✦ What Weighs on Them                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Find media that aligns with her values without feeling preachy            | Hyperaware of how tech platforms exploit her attention |
| Build a sustainable inner life alongside a chaotic outer one              | Climate anxiety is a daily presence                    |
| Feel connected to a larger human story                                    | Distrustful of corporate wellness washing              |
| Discover role models who look like her and come from where she comes from | Wants depth but has limited time and energy            |

**RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA & TECH**

Amara is on Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn, but she curates carefully and has done several social media detoxes. She reads newsletters like Reasons to Be Cheerful and subscribes to Substack writers she trusts. She has strong opinions about brand authenticity and will call out performative content immediately. She cares deeply about who is centered in stories — representation is political to her.

**HOW HANG IN THERE FITS IN THEIR DAY**

Amara would use Hang In There as a conscious replacement for the first phone check of the day — a morning ritual to orient herself before the noise starts. She'd follow the platform's social presence if it has one. She might donate if she feels ownership of the community. She'd share stories widely if they center voices often overlooked.

**Features They'll Love**

▸ No algorithm, no ads, no re-engagement tricks — radical honesty about the model

▸ Curated emoji reactions that reject cynicism (no thumbs down)

▸ Community story submissions — she wants to nominate West African community leaders

▸ Environmental stewardship stories — directly tied to her advocacy work

▸ The donation model — she respects platforms that don't monetize attention

**Story Themes That Resonate**

| Environmental Stewardship | Universal Love & Grace | Community & Mutual Support | Grit & Tenacity |
| :-----------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------: | :-------------: |

**Design & Tone Consideration**

Amara will scrutinize the design and content curation for who is being centered. A platform that claims universal love but defaults to Western, white, or male subjects will lose her trust permanently. The playful animations are a plus — she responds to delight — but the substance of who is featured in the first week of stories matters more than any design decision.
